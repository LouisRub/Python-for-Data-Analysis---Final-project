### Django Data Visualization and Modeling Platform
Welcome to our Django Data Visualization and Modeling Platform! This platform provides powerful tools for exploring and analyzing datasets, as well as creating customized models. With our user-friendly interface, you can gain deep insights from your data and make informed decisions. We can also see the code in the Final Project.ipynb

### Features
- Data Visualization: Easily visualize your datasets to uncover patterns and trends with interpretation
- Dataset Exploration: Access both the original and cleaned (non-encoded) and encoded (look .ipynb) versions of your dataset for transparency and understanding.
- Best Features : We choose for the model creation three model to explore more the dataset (SelectKBest, Linear Regression, ExtraTreesClassifier) and select the best columns for the model creation.
- In Django we can also choose our model within the three presented in django and choose how many features analyse.
- Model Creation: Choose from three different modeling options (ForestRegressing, SVM,..) and customize the number of features to create your own models.
- Interpretation: Gain meaningful interpretations from your models to understand the underlying information.

### Getting Started
To launch the Django site, follow these steps:

1. Install Django by running pip install django.
2. In the mysite folder, run the launchdjangoapi.py script.
3. Access the site through your preferred web browser.

You can also acces the Final Project.ipynb to see more detail like the model creation

### Usage
1. Dataset Visualization: Upload your dataset and explore it visually using the provided tools.
2. Dataset Comparison: Compare the original and cleaned datasets to understand the preprocessing steps.
3. Model Creation: Choose the type of model and customize the number of features to be more efficient.
4. Interpretation: Gain insights and interpretations from your models to understand the patterns and make predictions.
